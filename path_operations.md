When building APIs, you normally use these specific HTTP methods to perform a specific action.

Normally you use:

- POST: to create data.
- GET: to read data.
- PUT: to update data.
- DELETE: to delete data.
So, in OpenAPI, each of the HTTP methods is called an "operation".

We are going to call them "operations" too.
